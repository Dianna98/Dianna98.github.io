<p><strong>Open Data Cleaning</strong></p>
<p>For cleaning the dataset, I did not use any tools. I decided that being a small set of data, manually going through
    the Microsoft Excel file would be more efficient as a first pass. Below are the errors extracted manually and the
    transformations performed to solve them.</p>

<p>After the manual data cleaning, I converted the Excel tables to CSV and validated the relationships between them
    using python and the pandas library. Below is the list of validations performed, all of which have passed.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sample Size
        <ul>
            <li>For each industry, the sum between the number of surveys sent out for workforce size under 250 and for
                workforce size of 250 and over should be equal to the total specified.
            </li>
            <li>The total number of surveys sent out for all given industries per workforce size should be at least the
                sum of the number of surveys sent out for each industry.
            </li>
            <li>For the BICS survey broken down by workforce size, workforce size 0-99 + workforce size 100-249 = the
                total for all industries with workforce size &lt; 250 from the previous table.
            </li>
            <li>Workforce size 0-99 + workforce size 100-249 + workforce size 250+ = total number of surveys sent out
                for all industries and all size bands.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Response Rates
        <ul>
            <li>The checks applied for Sample Size.</li>
            <li>The data from the table &lsquo;Proportion of responses to the BICS survey broken down by industry&rsquo;
                should be in accordance with the rapport from the tables &lsquo;Responses to the BICS survey broken down
                by industry&rsquo; and &lsquo;Sample for the BICS survey broken down by industry&rsquo;.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Trading Status
        <ul>
            <li>For all three tables, the values from the 3 data columns should sum up to 100% &plusmn; 0.3%, to account
                for potential errors introduced by rounding.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Government Schemes
        <ul>
            <li>For the first table, the number of companies from all industries (calculated as total number of
                responses * percentage of industries which continue or have temporarily paused trading * percentage of
                companies which have applied for certain initiative) should be at least the sum of the number of
                companies for each industry (calculated in the same way).
            </li>
            <li>For the second table, using the formula presented in the previous point, the sum between workforce sizes
                should be approximately equal to the total. A small margin is allowed due to possible errors introduced
                by rounding.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Government Schemes (2)
        <ul>
            <li>The checks described for Government Schemes.</li>
            <li>For each industry, the percentage of received initiatives should be less than the percentage applied
                for.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Government Schemes (3)
        <ul>
            <li>The checks described for Government Schemes.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
